# BinarySearchTree
Implementation a binary search tree in JavaScript

I am just starting to learn JavaScript and figured a good way to familarize myself with the new language was to make something similar to what I have made in the past with C++ (language I have the most experience with)

A binary search tree is actually pretty similar to a sorted linked list in many ways, but has many more cases to consider.

For the sake of simplicity, I am only considering the case where all values in the tree are **numbers**.

My end goal is to implement a binary search tree that takes user input to perform the following five functions:
  1. insert a value to the tree
  2. remove a value from the tree
  3. print the entire tree (inorder, preorder, or postorder)
  4. search the tree for a specified value
  5. close the program

This program is intended for personal education, and I plan on updating it as I learn more concepts in JavaScript


Along with this README file, this repository contains:
  1. a JavaScript file with the entire implementation of the binary search tree (BinarySearchTree.js)
  2. an html file to run said JavaScript file (BinarySearchTree.html)(I plan to expand on this after I finish implementing all functionality)
